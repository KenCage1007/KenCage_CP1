      <!--
        Note: We'll learn about semantic tags more this week, but an article is a good semantic
        choice here to group the information about a single quote and the author/source. If
        you want to have multiple quotes, try duplicating this
        "card UI" structure

            You wanna know what scares people? Success. When you don't make moves and you don't climb up the ladder, everybody loves you because you're not competition.
